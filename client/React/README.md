### **Develop with React**:

There are several ways to start a React project [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

In this project, [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) is used. It allows us create a project with a TypeScript setup.

### **Build and run** the app:

Follow:

- clone or download code, navigate to project's root folder
- install modules with `npm install`
- Run the App with `npm start`
- A browser window will be opened.
- Enjoy your app
